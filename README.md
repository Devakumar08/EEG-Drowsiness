# Improved EEG-Based Driver Drowsiness Recognition

This repository contains an improved implementation of the "InterpretableCNN" model proposed in the paper "EEG-Based Cross-Subject Driver Drowsiness Recognition With an Interpretable Convolutional Neural Network" by J. Cui, Z. Lan, O. Sourina, and W. MÃ¼ller-Wittig. The improvements focus on enhancing the accuracy of the original model.

**Contribution:**
The project's standout achievement involves elevating the existing model's accuracy from 78.02% to 80.4%. This improvement was meticulously achieved through fine-tuning hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs.

## Model Accuracy Improvement

Beyond accuracy metrics, the model generates a topological heatmap overlaid on the input EEG signal, revealing spatial activity patterns, and provides relative power values for Delta, Theta, Alpha, and Beta frequency bands. These insights offer a comprehensive understanding of the EEG signal's spectral characteristics, underscoring the project's significance in advancing both deep learning and neuroscience.

## Project Overview

The project is implemented in Python 3.6.6 and includes three main code files:

1. **InterpretableCNN.py**: Contains the implementation of the improved InterpretableCNN model. Required library: torch.

2. **LeaveOneOut_acc.py**: Implements the leave-one-subject-out method to calculate classification accuracies. This requires a CUDA-supported GPU. Required libraries: torch, scipy, numpy, sklearn.

3. **VisTechnique.py**: Contains a novel visualization technique proposed in the paper. It also requires a CUDA-supported GPU. Required libraries: torch, scipy, numpy, matplotlib, mne.

## Dataset

The processed dataset used in this project is available on Figshare: [EEG Driver Drowsiness Dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/EEG_driver_drowsiness_dataset/14273687)

## Usage

1. **InterpretableCNN.py**: Run this file to train and test the improved InterpretableCNN model.

2. **LeaveOneOut_acc.py**: Execute this file to apply the leave-one-subject-out method for classification accuracies.

3. **VisTechnique.py**: Run this file to visualize the results using the proposed technique. Note: There may be Deprecation Warnings for mne library version v0.19.2; it has been tested and works perfectly with v0.18.
